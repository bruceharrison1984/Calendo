Is Schedulely not exactly what you wanted? Here are some other libraries that also offer calendar functionality similar to what Schedulely provides.
Open-source initiatives are important, so I think it is a good idea to shine a light on one another.

- [react-big-calendar](https://github.com/jquense/react-big-calendar)
  - Month view along with multiple other views
- [kalend](https://github.com/nibdo/kalend)
  - Month view along with multiple other views
- [fullcalendar-react](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar-react)
  - Month view along with multiple other views(based on the classic FullCalendar)
