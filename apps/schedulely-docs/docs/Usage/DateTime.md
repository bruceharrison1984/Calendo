Dates are currently handled in the **default JS string ISO format**. Internally, all strings are converted into back into native JS Date objects. The long-term plan
is to switch over to `Temporal` once it starts appearing in browsers with some degree of frequency.

The current `Temporal` polyfills are incomplete and suffer from issues such as extremely slow processing, huge package size, or only supporting the latest versions of node.

## DateTimeAdapter

All date operations are implemented using the `DateTimeAdapter`. This allows for other implementations to be easily added if needed.

## Timezones

Currently, any dates passed in will be parsed in to the local timezone of the browser.
This should work fine for SPAs, but SSR apps will potentially have problems with date-drift due to differential timezones.

Please submit any issues regarding this.
