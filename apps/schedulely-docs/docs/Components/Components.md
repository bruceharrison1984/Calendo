title: ðŸ”§ Components

## _Section Disclaimer_

_The components shown in this section represent the default components, and normally would be over-ridden and not directly instantiated.
They are shown here to help identify where they appear within Schedulely, and to aid in developing custom versions._

_The example code may contain additional elements that are not used or necessary within the context of the actual component(Schedulely), but are
necessary to display an example._

## Description

Schedulely is comprised of a number of smaller components that all work together to display the overall component. Care has been taken to make sure these can be easily over-ridden.

The default components contain very little behavior outside of simply being displayed. Implementing things such as `onClick` handlers or selection is entirely up to the end user. While the Default components can be restyled, the approach _we recommend is creating custom components for the display and actions that your project requires_.

The default components aren't really extensible. For example, the default event component onClick handler just prints the event data in to the console. As a consumer, you would extend the `EventComponent` interface to implement your own Event component that has the behavior you require.

All default components have interfaces available, and custom components can be passed in via the `schedulelyComponents` property.

Care should be taken when styling custom components. The underlying calendar layout is flexible, but it can still be easily broken.

## Overriding Components

If you do decide to use custom components, your implementation is just passed into the constructor.

Components are individually overridden so if you create a custom DayComponent, you only need to pass in that DayComponent. Default components are used if they are not explicitly overridden.

```tsx
  <Schedulely
    events={storyEvents}
    dark={colorMode === 'dark'}
    theme={theme}
    schedulelyComponents={{
      dayComponent: <ComponentThatInheritsDayComponent>,
      headerComponent: <ComponentThatInheritsHeaderComponent>,
      eventComponent: <ComponentThatInheritsEventComponent>,
    }}
  />
```

## Interfaces

The following interfaces should be used to craft custom components to be used in Schedulely.

| Component       | Description                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| DayComponent    | Represents a single Day on the calendar             |
| EventComponent  | Single event on the calendar                        |
| HeaderComponent | The toolbar that appears at the top of the calendar |
