# Start of Week

Schedulely provides an easy way to change the day that calendar starts on.

## Usage

You will need to manually pass in the `createDefaultAdapter` to the `dateAdapter` property.

```tsx
import { Schedulely, WeekDay, createDefaultAdapter } from 'schedulely';

<Schedulely dateAdapter={createDefaultAdapter('en', Weekday.Monday)} />;
```

The calendar is setup to try it's best to wrap the trailing/leading days evenly on the top and bottom respectively. However, the top takes priority for the current month and if the current month starts on the chosen start of the week day, you will not see trailing days from the previous month.
