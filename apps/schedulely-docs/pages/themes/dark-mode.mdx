# Dark Mode

Dark mode is supported by setting the `dark` attribute to `true` on the main Schedulely component. We known there are countless
ways to trigger dark mode in other components (media query, html tag, data-tag,etc) and rather than force a specific implementation
upon your application, we'll let you decide the best way to communicate to Schedulely that `Dark Mode` should be enabled by providing
a single entry point.

<Callout type="warning">
  For custom themes, specific CSS selectors are used based on the `dark`
  attribute. See the included styles for guidance on how to implement dark/light
  themes.
