# Dark Mode

Dark mode is supported by setting the `dark` attribute to `true` on the main Schedulely component.
Specific CSS selectors can be used to based on this attribute. See the included styles for guidance.

### Why an attribute?

There are countless ways to trigger dark mode (media query, html data-tag, etc) and rather than force an implementation upon your application, we'll let you
decide the best way to communicate to Schedulely that Dark Mode should be enabled.
