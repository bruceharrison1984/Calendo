# Event Component

## Description

The `EventComponent` how events are displayed within Schedulely. The `EventComponent` itself is purely concerned with display, it's overall length is determined
internally based on the start/end of the event. The `hover` effect is also handled internally, so all you need to do is describe what action should be taken if
the event happens to be hovered.

<Callout type="info">
  The following example displays how to create a custom Event component. You
  aren't required to create an EventComponent unless you want to override the
  default version.
</Callout>

## Example (DefaultEvent)

<EventComponentLiveExample />

## Custom Event Component

The `EventComponent` also has an optional generic parameter that can be used to enforce strong-typing of the `data` property. This can be leveraged if writing
your own custom EventComponent.

More information can be found on the [Custom Event Data Page](/usage/event-data/custom-event-data).

### Extra Event Data

Additional data can be passed in by utilizing the `data` property on the `CalendarEvent` type.
If using Typescript, you can passing the generic parameter to get strong-typing in your components. This isn't strictly necessary, but it is helpful if you are
creating a custom Event component.

## Component Props

```tsx
export interface EventComponentProps<T extends object = {}> {
  event: InternalCalendarEvent<T>;
  isHovered: boolean;
  onClick: (event: InternalCalendarEvent<T>) => void;
}
```
